Ciao questa è la wiki del progetto di LSMDB

## Obiettivi del branch amaryllis (20/10)
- It was implemented the registration mechanism, by modyfing the structure of Fundracing class as to include an inner class, RegistrationForm, existing only in the scope of the application instance and used for allowing the user to insert its data in a new frame. Both Fundracing and RegistrationForm are front-end classes which interact with the database through DepositoDati and Connect.
Why is RegistrationFrom an inner class? Because its scope is within the cicle of life of Fundracing and because, as of Java documentation, the use of inner or nested class is recomended for enabling encapsulation and improving code readibility. A *Singleton* implementation of the registration mechanism is currently _under consideration_.
- (discarded, as already solved in Lucia's branch, _code available upon need and request_) the implementation of a choice menu to select the receiver of the stake request. Class Choice from java.awt was used in the discarded solution, implementing a callback mechanism (applying an Observer pull methodology) in order to keep it up-to-date with the registration of new companies to the network.
- (to be done, as not clear if it can be simplified by exploiting Guido's work) a Listener thread to store and retrieve messages from a shared UnifiedQueue<String>.

### Implementation of _Fundracing_

## Schema della classe

## descrizione delle modifiche
E' stato aggiunto un evento al bottone register: Button tale per cui, quando viene cliccato, viene inizializzato il campo privato form:RegistrationForm. Tramite un meccanismo di callback, Fundracing si occupa di inizializzare l'attributo privato interface:Interfaccia della propria istanza di RegistrationForm.

```
form= new RegistrationForm();
form.getInterface()=new Interface(form);
form.setVisible(true);
```
#attributi privati nuovi
- form:RegistrationForm
- register:Button


### Implementation of _Registration Form_
## main idea
The main aim of class RegistrationForm is to provide the user with a mechanism to insert all the information concerning its agency, in order to joint the foundraising scheme. Checks are performed on all the inserted data before allowing the insert, that is:


- The agency musn't already be enrolled with the same business name in the network.
- The entered information regarding the password, in fields _password_ and _confirm password_ of the form, must coincide. In return, the class will provide the user with a mechanism to insert the password without showing the single characters;
- The ZIP code, as for the specifi constraints given to attribute _cap_ in the scheme of table _Agenzia_, must be a numeric sequence.
- All fields must be filled before submitting the form.
